# CLAUDE.md — Universal Development Principles

> Base file for every project in this folder. Project-specific CLAUDE.md files extend this; they never duplicate it. When a project file conflicts with this one, the project file wins (it's the local source of truth).
>
> Companion files: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) is the *how* for AI agents; [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) is the *look* for any project with a UI.

## North star: ship small things that work end-to-end

Everything below is in service of one rule: **build the smallest version that works, then add only what the next user need demands.** Karpathy's "make it work, then make it good"; levels.io's "ship it ugly, ship it now." A working ugly thing teaches you more in a day than a beautiful plan teaches you in a month.

Three operational consequences:

- **No half-finished work.** Don't merge a feature that's 80% done with a TODO for the rest. Either it ships end-to-end or it's a branch.
- **No speculative abstraction.** Three similar lines beats a premature helper. Build the helper the second time you need it, not the first.
- **No "future-proofing" without a present user.** Every config knob, plugin point, and feature flag is dead weight until someone uses it.

## Agent Workflow: Explore → Plan → Code → Verify

Never blindly write code. Always follow this loop:

1. **Explore.** Search the codebase. Find relevant files, understand existing patterns before touching anything.
2. **Plan.** Assess the blast radius (how many files, how long). For significant changes, present 2–3 high-level approaches with pros/cons and ask for human approval before writing code.
3. **Code.** Implement following the rules below.
4. **Verify.** Run tests. Use the feature. Fix all failures before declaring done.

**Read before edit.** Always read a file before editing it, even if it was read earlier in the conversation.

**Ask for options first.** On non-trivial tasks, propose approaches before writing code. The first plausible plan is rarely the best plan.

**Close the loop yourself.** Build projects so the agent can compile, lint, run tests, and verify its own output without a human in the middle. When the agent can close the loop, you can trust the result. (Karpathy: "agentic coding works when the eval is the loop.")

---

## Communication style

- **Concise output.** No filler, no apologies, no moralizing. Skip generic advice.
- **Show your work.** Short reasoning when it changes the answer; silence when it doesn't.
- **Fail loud.** No catch-all exception handlers that silently swallow errors. Raise or log explicitly.
- **State results, not effort.** "Tests pass" beats "I worked hard to get tests to pass." Don't narrate.

---

## Architecture principles

- **No over-engineering.** Only make changes directly requested or clearly necessary. Keep solutions simple.
- **Boring tech wins.** Vanilla JS, SQLite, static HTML, system fonts, plain Python beat the framework-of-the-month. Every dependency is a future bug, a future migration, and a future security advisory. (levels.io: "boring tech is the secret.")
- **Single source of truth.** Constants, configs, and shared types derive from one place. If a value is duplicated, write a test that asserts the copies match.
- **Modular layers.** Separate concerns — data fetching, processing, storage, and presentation are distinct modules.
- **Idempotent operations.** Re-running anything should be safe and produce the same result. `INSERT OR IGNORE`, cache checks, deduplication by unique key.
- **Static when possible.** Prefer baked-in data over runtime backends when the update cycle allows. A `docs/` folder served by GitHub Pages beats a server you have to babysit.
- **Cost-optimized.** Stay on free tiers; use the cheapest resource that meets the requirement.
- **CLI-first.** Build CLI entry points before UI. Agents can invoke CLIs to self-validate output, closing the feedback loop without human intervention.
- **Minimize page weight and request count.** Audit total payload size and request count. Content-focused sites should be lightweight — fewest requests, smallest payload.
- **Tree-shake and code-split.** Don't bundle every controller for every page. Lazy-load what's only needed on demand.
- **Benchmark against best-in-class.** Compare your site against well-optimized references. If the simplest site in your org is orders of magnitude lighter, your build process needs review.
- **Document subsystems.** Maintain a `docs/` folder with notes on non-obvious subsystems, design decisions, and correct CLI invocations. One line of documentation prevents repeated mistakes.

---

## Error resilience

- **Never let one item crash the pipeline.** Wrap per-record processing in try/except. Log and continue.
- **Log aggressively.** Every request, parse, API call, cache hit/miss, and filter decision should be logged.
- **Cache everything fetchable.** Re-runs must be fast and cheap. Multi-layer caching where it pays off.
- **Validate everything.** Invalid responses from external services → log and skip, never crash.
- **Track errors visibly.** Use an `issues.md` file or errors array — failures must surface, not silently disappear.

---

## Security & credential handling

- **Never commit secrets.** API keys, tokens, and passwords never appear in committed code.
- Read credentials from environment variables only. Halt with a clear error if missing.
- Never log or print credential values.
- Always `.gitignore`: `.env`, `.env.local`, `credentials.json`, `secrets/`, `node_modules/`, `__pycache__/`, `dist/`, `*.pyc`.
- Before committing: `git diff --cached | grep -iE "apikey|password|token|secret"`.
- **Respect user privacy choices.** Don't proxy tracking SDKs through your own domain to bypass blockers. That erodes user trust permanently.
- **Check advisories before any package install / upgrade.** Supply-chain attacks land in popular npm/pip packages within hours of a maintainer being phished. Before suggesting or running `npm install` / `pip install`, fetch the latest advisory index at `https://pranava0x0.github.io/vibe-coding-security/llms-ctx.txt` (~12 KB, compact format). If the package or pattern matches a listed advisory, surface the warning before proceeding. Also maintain a `security.md` per project with the date of the last advisory sweep; refresh if older than 7 days.

---

## Testing & validation

- **Write tests alongside code, not as an afterthought.** Every new module or bug fix includes corresponding tests.
- **Regression test every bug fix.** The bug is the test case; without one, the fix rots.
- **Validate output data against expected schemas before writing to disk.** Pydantic with `extra="forbid"` (Python) or zod (TS) is the right shape.
- **Cover edges, not just happy paths:** empty `[] / {} / ""`; null for every optional field; boundary values; combined filters.
- **Run the full test suite before committing** to catch regressions.
- **Never ship test files to production.** CI excludes test files, fixtures, and debug artifacts from production bundles.
- **Tests are the eval suite.** Karpathy on LLMs: "your eval is the loop." Same for software — your test suite is the loop that tells you what works. Invest in it.

---

## Git discipline

- **Commit often** at natural checkpoints — small, focused commits over large monolithic ones.
- **Per natural unit:** per new module / feature, per bug fix (with its regression test), per doc update.
- **Descriptive messages explain *what* and *why*.** Not "fix bug" — "fix off-by-one in pagination when filter is empty."
- **Never commit large binaries, downloaded data, or API keys.**
- **Don't amend pushed commits.** Create new commits — amend rewrites history that may already be on a teammate's machine.
- **Don't `--no-verify`.** If a hook fails, fix the underlying issue. Hooks exist because someone got burned.
- **No agent co-authors.** Never add `Co-Authored-By:` lines for AI coding agents (Claude, Copilot, etc.) in commit messages. Commits are owned by the human who reviews and ships the work. Enforce per-repo with `git config --local claude.coauthor false`; set globally once with `git config --global claude.coauthor false` to cover all repos.

---

## Data handling

- **Append-only data.** Append new records rather than overwriting. Deduplicate via unique keys.
- **Source attribution.** Every data record carries its origin (source URL, connector name, capture date). Users must be able to trace any value back to where it came from.
- **Defensive optional field handling.** Null-check every optional field before rendering or processing.
- **Null values render as explicit placeholders** ("N/A", "Not disclosed", "—") — never blank UI elements.
- **Capture dates over "current" framing.** External sources change; record `captured_at` and surface "as of YYYY-MM-DD" so historical drift is visible.

---

## Issue tracking (`issues.md`)

Maintain a living `issues.md` in the project root as an audit trail.

- Each bug: date, module/area, description, root cause (**code bug** vs. **test bug**), status (Open / Fixed).
- On resolution: what the fix was + the commit that resolved it.
- After every bug fix, check whether a new regression test is needed.

---

## Backlog (`backlog.md`)

Maintain a `backlog.md` for ideas, features, and enhancements.

- Add ideas immediately when they come up — don't lose them.
- Each item: brief description + priority (low / medium / high).
- Review and reprioritize periodically. Demote stale "high" items to "low" rather than letting them rot at the top.

---

## Python standards

*(Apply when the project uses Python.)*

- Type hints on all functions.
- `pathlib.Path` for file paths.
- `logging` module — no bare `print` for runtime output.
- All constants in a single config module.
- Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Pydantic for data validation.
- Python 3.9+ unless specified otherwise.

---

## Frontend standards

*(Apply when the project has a web frontend. Full design system lives in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).)*

- Functional components + hooks only. No class components.
- Colors, enums, and constants in a dedicated file — never hardcoded inline.
- Data transforms belong in hooks or utility functions, not in components.
- Loading, error, and empty states on every view.
- Visible focus indicators on every interactive element.
- **Mobile-first responsive design.** Test at 375px (iPhone SE) before declaring done.
- TypeScript strict mode when the project uses TypeScript. No `any`.
- **Touch targets ≥ 44px.** Non-negotiable on touch devices.
- **Deduplicate image assets.** Each image once; use `<picture>` with `srcset` so the browser picks AVIF / WebP / PNG. Never serve uncompressed PNGs for content.
- **Only load libraries used on the page.** No backend-only deps leaking into read-only frontend pages.
- **Descriptive `alt` on every content image.** Never `alt=""`.
- **Responsive CSS, not duplicate DOM trees.** Handle mobile / desktop with media queries — never render the same content twice.
- **The `[hidden]` trap.** Writing `display: inline-flex` / `display: block` on an element that also uses the `hidden` HTML attribute makes the CSS rule win and the attribute become a no-op. Always pair `display: ...` overrides with an explicit `[hidden] { display: none }` rule.

---

## Network ethics & rate limiting

*(Apply when the project fetches from external sources.)*

- Minimum 1.5–2s delay between requests to any single host.
- Informative `User-Agent` header.
- 429 → exponential backoff starting at 10s.
- Cache all fetched content to disk. Re-runs never re-download cached content.
- If a service persistently blocks after retries, log to `issues.md` and gracefully skip. Never crash.
- **Start small.** Validate a scraper against a handful of pages before scaling to full runs.

---

## AI / API cost optimization

*(Apply when the project uses LLM APIs.)*

- Use the cheapest model that meets quality requirements (e.g., Haiku before Opus).
- Keyword pre-filtering to skip irrelevant content before sending to expensive APIs.
- Truncate / excerpt input to reduce token usage.
- Cache API responses by content hash. Never re-classify identical content.
- Log cost impact at each optimization layer. Print a cost summary at the end of each run.
- `--dry-run` and `--fetch-only` modes must work without an API key.

---

## Working with AI agents (meta-principles)

This file *is* the guidance an AI agent reads on entry. These rules are how to use the agent well.

- **Context is RAM, not memory.** (Karpathy: LLMs are "fuzzy CPUs"; context is the working set.) Fill it with what's needed for the current task — no more, no less. Watch for *context poisoning* (early errors that compound), *context distraction* (irrelevant content that buries what matters), and *context clash* (contradictory instructions).
- **Start fresh on topic switches.** Use `/clear` between unrelated problems. Long mixed-topic contexts degrade quality. Break complex tasks into small steps and commit between them.
- **AI has no taste.** Actively review output for: excessive try/catch, unnecessary abstractions, code bloat instead of refactoring, generic naming, and poor judgment on simplicity vs. structure. These are recurring failure modes that require human correction.
- **AI is a tool, not a substitute for engineering discipline.** Apply fundamentals to AI-generated code: performance audits, bundle analysis, code review, optimization passes. High LOC means nothing if the code is bloated.
- **Vibe coding is fine for throwaway; engineer the rest.** Karpathy: vibe coding works when you never have to maintain the code. The moment a user depends on it, you owe it engineering discipline.
- **Closed-loop validation.** Build projects so the agent can compile, lint, run tests, and verify its own output without intervention. This is the single biggest force multiplier — when the agent can answer "did it work?" itself, every iteration is fast.
- **Keep this file current.** When something unexpected happens — a pattern that failed, a correct CLI invocation, a library quirk — add a concise note. This file grows incrementally as organizational scar tissue. It is not rewritten from scratch.
- **Write big plans to files.** For large tasks, write the spec to a `docs/` markdown file and review it before executing. Persists context across sessions; allows second-opinion review before building.
- **Sweep for orphaned wrapper shells after every long-running command.** Bash `run_in_background` calls wrapping data refreshes (especially polling-loop wrappers like `until ps -p $(pgrep -f "...") >/dev/null; do sleep N; done`) can outlive the watched process. Once the PID exits, `pgrep` returns empty, `$(pgrep)` is `""`, `ps -p ""` always fails, and the `until` loop can never resolve — the wrapper shell sleeps forever. Run `pgrep -fl "<project-path>"` before declaring done; `kill` any lingering wrappers. Two design fixes: (1) prefer a Monitor tool over inline `until`+`sleep` polling; (2) if using Bash, invert to `while pgrep -f "..."; do sleep N; done` so the loop exits *when* the process disappears.

## Influences

The patterns above are distilled from running many small projects in this folder. Two outside voices shaped them:

- **Andrej Karpathy** — "make it work, then make it good"; the LLM-as-fuzzy-CPU framing; eval-as-the-loop; context engineering over prompt engineering; the closed-loop bar for trustworthy agents; vibe-coding as the right tool for throwaway and the wrong tool for production.
- **Pieter Levels (levels.io)** — ship fast and ugly; boring tech beats shiny tech; solo-friendly defaults (vanilla, SQLite, single-file apps, cheap hosting); profit before scale; don't add a dependency you can't maintain alone; talk to users daily.

When in doubt, both would say the same thing: **ship the smallest version that works, then iterate based on what real users do, not what you imagine they'll do.**
